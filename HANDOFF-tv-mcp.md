## Current state

**openScript rebinding gap closed (Session 12).** `openScript` now runs the `new_indicator` Monaco action before `setValue`, mirroring `newScript`'s safety pattern. Editor lands as an unbound draft holding the loaded source — title shows "Untitled script", `isSaveEnabled` flips through the unbound path on the next save. Cost: persisting back requires `pine_save({ name })` which creates a NEW slot (loud duplicate in the user's library) instead of overwriting in-place. The per-id overwrite endpoint remains a known follow-up. Code on disk, **not yet committed**. Restart Claude Code to pick it up — running MCP processes have the old code.

**Fix 1+2 closed out. Patch verified green end-to-end and pushed (`e7b4a2f`, 2026-06-09 — Session 11).** Fix 3 shipped 2026-06-05.

Session 11 ran the proof-gate sequence cleanly with a force-claim coordinated against the live ICC instance:

```
pine_claim(force=true)        → claimed
pine_new(indicator)           → unbound_draft_created, model_uri: ...?placement%3Ddialog
pine_set_source               → lines_set: 4
pine_save(name=...)           → action: saved_as_new, verified: true
                                scriptIdPart: USER;b465c8a4e8854a58956e59822e644fbf
pine_list_scripts             → +1 entry, slot present
pine_get_source               → matches input byte-for-byte
pine_release                  → released
```

ICC rv3 — Spec Viz (v11.0) untouched throughout. Tests: 94/94 unit pass. The 3 e2e failures are pre-existing TV-side drift (deprecated `tv_launch` binary path, `bottomWidgetBar.hideWidget` removed, `replay_stop` state assertion) — not touched by this patch.

## Immediate next action

**Before `npm test`: ensure no other Claude/CDP process is hitting Chrome.** A background test run during Session 11 reported 60 failures starting with an 18-minute `chart_set_symbol` timeout — caused by CDP contention with live `ui_evaluate` probes, NOT real regressions. On a quiet Chrome, expect ~160/160. Anything in the 80-100 pass range means Chrome is busy; close other lanes and retry.

Two open follow-ups, both safe to defer:

1. **Per-id overwrite endpoint.** With the Session 12 fix, `pine_open` + edits + `pine_save({name})` creates a duplicate slot rather than overwriting the original. The proper fix is the per-id save endpoint that TV's own `save.script` Monaco command uses — but a sniff attempt with `save.script` on an unbound editor produced **zero fetches** (the unbound fuse holds, no URL captured). To capture: open a script via TV's UI (manually click the title button → "Open script…" → pick one), confirm title-button now shows the script's real name + isSaveEnabled flips through bound path, type a single char to dirty the buffer, run the sniffer probe (`window.__pf_orig_fetch` pattern from Session 12 logs), then trigger `save.script`. The captured POST URL is the missing endpoint. Once known, wire `pine_save_to({ scriptIdPart, source })` for true in-place overwrite.

2. **Capture the real delete endpoint.** `POST /pine-facade/delete/<urlencoded-id>` returns `401 "not an owner"` (probably wrong shape). `DELETE` method is CORS-blocked from page context. `ui_evaluate` doesn't await Promises so async discovery needs a stash-on-`window`-and-poll pattern. **30-second job with Chrome DevTools:** delete one script via TV's UI, copy the actual request from Network tab, wire into a new `pine_delete` tool. Until then, 5 stale probes remain visible in `pine_list_scripts` — user clears via TV UI when convenient.

## Reference (still valid)
- `POST /pine-facade/save/new?name=<urlencoded>&allow_overwrite=true|false` (FormData `source=`) → creates slot, returns `body.result.metaInfo.scriptIdPart`. TV normalizes line-endings to `\r\n`.
- `GET /pine-facade/get/<urlencoded-id>/<version|"last">` → fetches source.
- Monaco actions reachable via `editor.getSupportedActions()`: `new_indicator`, `new_strategy`, `open.script`, etc. (`.run()` them).
- Monaco commands NOT in actions: `:save.script` via `editor._commandService.executeCommand` (gated on `isSaveEnabled`).
- Title button `[data-qa-id="pine-script-title-button"]` shows bound slot name or "Untitled script". **Secondary signal only** — see gotcha below.

## Known gotchas
- **`isSaveEnabled` + `placement%3Ddialog` are the real safety fuse, not the title button.** When `new_indicator` action runs, the editor's model swaps to one whose URI contains URL-encoded `placement%3Ddialog` and `isSaveEnabled` flips to false. `save.script` is gated on `isSaveEnabled`, so it noops on the unbound model — the bound slot is never touched. The title button DOM (`[data-qa-id="pine-script-title-button"]`) is a secondary signal: it can lag the active editor state and can pick up stale elements when both main-pane and dialog-popout DOMs coexist. Read `isSaveEnabled` for truth; read the title button for human-readable context only.
- **There is only ONE Monaco editor instance at a time.** `env.editor.getEditors()` returns length 1. When TV swaps to a dialog popout, the editor's MODEL changes (new URI), but it's the same Monaco instance. Stale `.monaco-editor.pine-editor-monaco` DOM elements may linger from previous mounts — don't confuse a stale DOM node with a second editor.
- **URI placement comparison uses URL-encoded form.** Model URIs serialize `?placement=dialog` as `?placement%3Ddialog`. Code that sniffs the URI must match `placement%3Ddialog` (or decode first), not `placement=dialog`.
- **FIND_MONACO returns `{editor, env}` NOT the monaco namespace.** `m.editor` = editor instance (has `setValue`/`getValue`/`getModel`/`getSupportedActions`). `m.env` = namespace (has `editor.getEditors`). Session 10's regression was getting this backwards (now fixed in `e7b4a2f`).
- **MCP processes don't hot-reload.** Restart Claude Code to pick up `src/` edits.
- **Singleton pine_editor claim is account-global.** Two MCP processes can't both write Pine — escape hatch is `TV_MCP_PINE_WRITE_UNGATED=1`. Stale claims auto-prune on registry read.
- **`ui_evaluate` does NOT await Promises** — async IIFEs return `{}`. Stash result on `window.__X`, poll via subsequent sync evaluate.
- **`evaluate` alias trap** in `src/core/chart.js`/`drawing.js`/`replay.js`: imported as `_evaluate`, requires `const { evaluate } = _resolve(_deps)` before bare calls.
- **`chrome_launch`'s 5s wait can be a false negative** on cold starts — probe `chrome_health` before assuming failure.
- **Pin state ≠ registry state.** `setPin`/`clearPin` in `connection.js` are in-process-only; `claimAndPin`/`releaseAndUnpin` also touch `~/.tv-mcp-registry.json`. Tools go through the registry path; internal reconnect uses bare `setPin`.
