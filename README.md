Personal AI assistant for your TradingView charts running in Chrome. Connects Claude Code to a local Chrome session displaying TradingView via Chrome DevTools Protocol for AI-assisted chart analysis, Pine Script development, and workflow automation.

> [!WARNING]
> **This tool is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or associated with TradingView Inc.** It interacts with your locally running TradingView session (running in Chrome) via Chrome DevTools Protocol. Review the [Disclaimer](#disclaimer) before use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Requires a valid TradingView subscription.** This tool does not bypass or circumvent any TradingView paywall or access control. It reads from and controls the TradingView session already running in Chrome on your machine.

> [!NOTE]
> **All data processing occurs locally on your machine.** No TradingView data is transmitted, stored, or redistributed externally by this tool.

> [!CAUTION]
> This tool accesses undocumented internal TradingView web-app APIs via Chrome DevTools Protocol. These can change or break without notice in any TradingView update. Pin your Chrome version if stability matters to you.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Chrome 136+ requires `--user-data-dir=<non-default>`.** Chrome refuses to bind the debug port on the default profile as an anti-credential-theft measure. The MCP launches an isolated profile automatically. See `CLAUDE.md` ("Chrome setup") for the full failure-mode dictionary and the durable profile path used on this machine.

## How It Works (and why it's safe to run)

This tool does not connect to TradingView's servers, modify any TradingView files, or intercept any network traffic. It communicates exclusively with your locally running Chrome (displaying TradingView) via Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) — a standard debugging interface built into all Chromium-based applications by Google, including VS Code, Slack, and Discord.

The debug port is disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled by you using a standard Chromium flag (`--remote-debugging-port=9222`). Nothing happens without that deliberate step.

## What This Tool Does Not Do

- Connect to TradingView's servers or APIs
- Store, transmit, or redistribute any market data
- Work without a valid TradingView subscription and Chrome browser
- Bypass any TradingView paywall or access restriction
- Execute real trades (chart interaction only)
- Work if TradingView changes their internal web app structure

## Research Context

This project explores an open research question: **how can LLM-based agents interact with professional trading interfaces to support human decision-making?**

Specifically it investigates:

- How structured tool APIs (MCP) can bridge LLMs and stateful desktop financial applications
- What latency, context, and reliability constraints emerge when an agent operates on live chart data
- How agents handle ambiguous financial UI state (e.g. interpreting Pine Script output, reading indicator tables)
- Whether natural language is an effective interface for chart navigation and Pine Script development
- The failure modes of LLM agents operating in real-time data environments

This is not a trading bot. It is an interface layer that makes a trading application legible to an LLM agent, allowing researchers and developers to study human-AI collaboration in financial workflows.

See [RESEARCH.md](RESEARCH.md) for open questions, findings, and related work.

## Prerequisites

- **TradingView account + Chrome** (paid subscription required for real-time data)
- **Node.js 18+**
- **Claude Code** with MCP support (for MCP tools) or any terminal (for CLI)
- **macOS, Windows, or Linux**

## What It Does

Gives your AI assistant eyes and hands on your own chart:

- **Pine Script development** — write, inject, compile, debug, and iterate on scripts with AI assistance
- **Chart navigation** — change symbols, timeframes, zoom to dates, add/remove indicators
- **Visual analysis** — read your chart's indicator values, price levels, and annotations
- **Draw on charts** — trend lines, horizontal lines, rectangles, text annotations
- **Manage alerts** — create, list, and delete price alerts
- **Replay practice** — step through historical bars, practice entries/exits
- **Screenshots** — capture chart state for AI visual analysis
- **Multi-pane layouts** — set up 2x2, 3x1, etc. grids with different symbols per pane
- **Monitor your chart** — stream JSONL from your locally running chart for local monitoring scripts
- **CLI access** — every MCP tool is also a `tv` CLI command, pipe-friendly with JSON output
- **Launch TradingView** — auto-detect and launch with debug mode from any platform

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ogdeeeezy/tv-mcp.git
cd tv-mcp
npm install
npm run setup
```

That's it for the setup side. `npm run setup` will:

1. Create an isolated Chrome profile (so Chrome 136+ will let it bind the debug port — required, not optional)
2. Launch Chrome against that profile with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`
3. Print a six-lane `mcp_config` block ready to paste into Claude Code

Then **three manual steps**:

1. In the new Chrome window, open <https://www.tradingview.com/chart/> and log in.
2. Copy the `mcp_config` JSON the script printed into `~/.claude/.mcp.json` (merge with any existing `mcpServers`).
3. Restart Claude Code, then ask: *"Use tv_health_check to verify TradingView is connected."*

### Why the isolated profile is mandatory

Starting in Chrome 136 (April 2025), Google's anti-credential-theft check refuses to bind `--remote-debugging-port` when the user-data-dir resolves to the OS-default Chrome profile. This is non-negotiable and a path-based check — passing the default path explicitly does not bypass it. `npm run setup` handles this for you by creating an isolated profile under your OS-appropriate config location (`~/Library/Application Support/tv-mcp-chrome` on macOS, `~/.config/tv-mcp-chrome` on Linux, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\tv-mcp-chrome` on Windows). Full failure-mode dictionary lives in [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) → "Chrome setup".

### Setup options

```bash
npm run setup -- --lanes 1                       # single-server config instead of six lanes
npm run setup -- --user-data-dir /custom/path    # override profile location
npm run setup -- --port 9333                     # use a different CDP port
```

### Manual install (if you'd rather not run `npm run setup`)

<details>
<summary>Click for manual launch + config steps</summary>

Launch Chrome yourself:

```bash
# macOS
"/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome" \
  --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
  --user-data-dir="$HOME/Library/Application Support/tv-mcp-chrome"

# Linux
google-chrome \
  --remote-debugging-port=9222 \
  --user-data-dir="$HOME/.config/tv-mcp-chrome"

# Windows
"C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe" ^
  --remote-debugging-port=9222 ^
  --user-data-dir="%LOCALAPPDATA%\tv-mcp-chrome"
```

Then paste this into `~/.claude/.mcp.json` (substitute the absolute path to your clone for `/path/to/tv-mcp`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tv-mcp-a": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/tv-mcp/src/server.js"] },
    "tv-mcp-b": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/tv-mcp/src/server.js"] },
    "tv-mcp-c": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/tv-mcp/src/server.js"] },
    "tv-mcp-d": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/tv-mcp/src/server.js"] },
    "tv-mcp-e": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/tv-mcp/src/server.js"] },
    "tv-mcp-f": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/tv-mcp/src/server.js"] }
  }
}
```

Six identical lanes let you pin different charts in parallel (e.g., `tv-mcp-a` on GC1!, `tv-mcp-b` on RBLX). Drop down to a single `tradingview` entry if you only ever look at one chart at a time.

</details>

### Verify

Ask Claude: *"Use tv_health_check to verify TradingView is connected."*

## CLI

Every MCP tool is also accessible as a `tv` CLI command. All output is JSON for piping with `jq`.

```bash
# Install globally (optional)
npm link

# Or run directly
node src/cli/index.js <command>
```

### Quick Examples

```bash
tv setup                           # one-shot: isolated Chrome + MCP config snippet
tv status                          # check connection
tv quote                           # current price
tv symbol AAPL                     # change symbol
tv ohlcv --summary                 # price summary
tv screenshot -r chart             # capture chart
tv pine compile                    # compile Pine Script
tv pane layout 2x2                 # 4-chart grid
tv pane symbol 1 ES1!              # set pane symbol
tv stream quote | jq '.close'      # monitor price changes
```

`tv setup` is what you run first on a fresh machine — it creates the isolated Chrome profile, launches Chrome with CDP on the right flags, and prints the six-lane `mcp_config` block ready to paste into `~/.claude/.mcp.json`. Equivalent to `npm run setup`.

### All Commands

```
tv setup / status / launch / state / symbol / timeframe / type / info / search
tv quote / ohlcv / values
tv data lines/labels/tables/boxes/strategy/trades/equity/depth/indicator
tv pine get/set/compile/analyze/check/save/new/open/list/errors/console
tv draw shape/list/get/remove/clear
tv alert list/create/delete

tv screenshot / discover / ui-state / range / scroll
```

## Streaming

The `tv stream` commands poll your local Chrome (with TradingView open) at regular intervals via Chrome DevTools Protocol on localhost.

No connection is made to TradingView's servers. All data stays on your machine.

> [!WARNING]
> Programmatic consumption of TradingView data may conflict with their Terms of Use regardless of the data source. You are solely responsible for ensuring your usage complies.

```bash
tv stream quote                          # price tick monitoring
tv stream bars                           # bar-by-bar updates
tv stream values                         # indicator value monitoring
tv stream lines --filter "NY Levels"     # price level monitoring
tv stream tables --filter Profiler       # table data monitoring
tv stream all                            # all panes at once (multi-symbol)
```

## How Claude Knows Which Tool to Use

Claude reads [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) automatically when working in this project. It contains a complete decision tree:

| You say... | Claude uses... |
|------------|---------------|
| "What's on my chart?" | `chart_get_state` → `data_get_study_values` → `quote_get` |
| "What levels are showing?" | `data_get_pine_lines` → `data_get_pine_labels` |
| "Read the session table" | `data_get_pine_tables` with `study_filter` |
| "Give me a full analysis" | `quote_get` → `data_get_study_values` → `data_get_pine_lines` → `data_get_pine_labels` → `data_get_pine_tables` → `data_get_ohlcv` (summary) → `capture_screenshot` |
| "Switch to AAPL daily" | `chart_set_symbol` → `chart_set_timeframe` |
| "Write a Pine Script for..." | `pine_set_source` → `pine_smart_compile` → `pine_get_errors` |
| "Start replay at March 1st" | `replay_start` → `replay_step` → `replay_trade` |
| "Set up a 4-chart grid" | `pane_set_layout` → `pane_set_symbol` for each pane |
| "Draw a level at 24500" | `draw_shape` (horizontal_line) |
| "Take a screenshot" | `capture_screenshot` |

## Tool Reference (78 MCP tools)

## Context Management

Tools return compact output by default to minimize context usage. For a typical "analyze my chart" workflow, total context is ~5-10KB instead of ~80KB.

| Feature | How it saves context |
|---------|---------------------|
| Pine lines | Returns deduplicated price levels only, not every line object |
| Pine labels | Capped at 50 per study, text+price only |
| Pine tables | Pre-formatted row strings, no cell metadata |
| Pine boxes | Deduplicated {high, low} zones only |
| OHLCV summary mode | Stats + last 5 bars instead of all bars |
| Indicator inputs | Encrypted/encoded blobs auto-filtered |
| `verbose: true` | Pass on any pine tool to get raw data with IDs/colors when needed |
| `study_filter` | Target one indicator instead of scanning all |

## Verifying CDP is Reachable

After `chrome_launch`, confirm the debug port is bound:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:9222/json/version | head
lsof -i :9222
```

If `lsof` returns nothing, Chrome's anti-credential-theft check is refusing to bind the port — almost always because `--user-data-dir` resolved to Chrome's default profile path. Re-launch with an isolated `--user-data-dir` (see step 2 above).

The MCP-side equivalent: `chrome_health` returns `{ alive: true }` when CDP is reachable.

## Testing

```bash
# Requires TradingView running with --remote-debugging-port=9222
npm test
```

29 tests covering: Pine Script static analysis, server-side compilation, and CLI routing.

## Architecture

```
Claude Code  ←→  MCP Server (stdio)  ←→  CDP (port 9222)  ←→  Chrome (isolated user-data-dir, TradingView open)
```

- **Transport**: MCP over stdio (78 tools) + CLI (`tv` command, 30 commands with 66 subcommands)
- **Connection**: Chrome DevTools Protocol on localhost:9222
- **Streaming**: Poll-and-diff loop with deduplication, JSONL output to stdout
- **No dependencies** beyond `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` and `chrome-remote-interface`
